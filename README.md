## Notes On Chapter 1 Introduction

### Terms

The following terms are introduced in this chapter.

__closed loop__ A system divided into parts that are interconnected in a cycle.

__dynamical system__ System whose behaviour changes over time. An example is a bathtub with water flowing into the tub through the facet and leaving through the drain.

__feedback__ Coupling between dynamical systems in a circular chain of cause and effect. An example is body temperature regulation, when your body temperature rises through exercise, you will start to sweat to release heat.

__feedforward__ Measuring disturbance and using this as input of a control system that proactively will take a corrective action to prevent the disturbance from affecting the output of the system. A feedforward controller will not measure the actual output of the system.

__negative feedback__ Type of feedback causing a response that will reverse or cause the opposite effect of the original stimulus. An example is body temperature regulation, when your body temperature rises through exercise, you will start to sweat to release heat.

__open loop__ A system where parts are not connected in a cycle as opposed to a closed loop system.

__positive feedback__ Type of feedback causing a response that will amplify the changes rather than reverse them, in other words the opposite of negative feedback. Encouragement is a form of positive feedback.
