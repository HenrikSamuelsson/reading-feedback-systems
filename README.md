## Notes On Chapter 1 Introduction

### Terms

Alphabetical list of terms introduced in chapter 1:

__closed loop__ A system divided into parts that are interconnected in a cycle. A system with feedback will include a closed loop.

__control__ This term is in the book defined as the use of algorithms and feedback in engineered systems.

__control law__ Algorithm in a control system that provides functionality to compute control action based on input from sensors.

__dynamical system__ System whose behaviour changes over time. An example is a bathtub with water flowing into the tub through the facet and leaving through the drain.

__feedback__ Coupling between dynamical systems in a circular chain of cause and effect. An example is body temperature regulation, when your body temperature rises through exercise, you will start to sweat to release heat.

__feedback loop__ Central concept in control involving a loop construction with sensing, computation, and actuation to give a system a desired behaviour.

__feedforward__ Measuring disturbance and using this as input of a control system to proactively take a corrective action preventing the disturbance from affecting the system. A feedforward controller will not measure the actual output of the system it is hence an open loop system.

__information__ Data in the form of signals in a control system, digital or analog.

__negative feedback__ Type of feedback causing a response that will reverse or cause the opposite effect of the original stimulus. An example is body temperature regulation, when your body temperature rises through exercise, you will start to sweat to release heat.

__open loop__ A system where parts are not connected in a cycle as opposed to a closed loop system.

__positive feedback__ Type of feedback causing a response that will amplify the changes rather than reverse them, in other words the opposite of negative feedback. Encouragement is a form of positive feedback.
