# Reading Feedback Systems

Material related to reading the book Feedback Systems - Second Edition, written by Karl Johan Åström and Richard M. Murray.

## Chapter One Introduction

### Terms

__dynamical system__ System whose behaviour changes over time. An example is a bathtub with water flowing into the tub through the facet and leaving through the drain.

__feedback__ Coupling between dynamical systems in a circular chain of cause and effect. An example is body temperature regulation, when your body temperature rises through exercise, you will start to sweat to release heat.

__feedforward__ Control based on a open-loop scheme that takes as disturbances as input to enable the control block to directly compensate without having feedback from the system output.
